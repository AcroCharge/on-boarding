# Welcome aboard to AcroCharge!

Here you can fund all you need to know in order for a more comfort onboard process (tech wise)

we sure some staff here you know, but it's here for a referents guid
## Code
here you will find all you need - code related
### General
* [Clean Code Book](https://enos.itcollege.ee/~jpoial/oop/naited/Clean%20Code.pdf)

### JavaScript
* [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts&ab_channel=TonyAlicea)

### Node.js
* [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)

### Common Libraries
* we are using mongodb as our main DB and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) as our ORM


### FrameWorks
* **Nest.js** framework in use in some of our backend service. here you can find [Nest.js Documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/)
* we're using **Next.js** framework in our client service. here you can find [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)


## Infrastructure
In AcroCharge we are working in a microservices' architecture for our services. And, monorepo to store our code base

### Basics
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) - our services software containers
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) - maneging our dockers deployment and etc'

### Mandatory
in order to manage our monorepo, our services, dependencies, common libraries we ar using [NX framework](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/getting-started/intro).
this tool is the one you're going to work with the most, so we advise to learn it well.

### Tools
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Our Main DB 
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - Message brokers
* [RabbitMQ](https://redis.io/) - In-memory data structure store using for cache
